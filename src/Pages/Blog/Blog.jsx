                <h1 className="text-3xl font-medium mb-5">What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where should we store them on the client-side?</h1>
                <p className="text-xl ">Answer: Access tokens and refresh tokens are components of an authentication and authorization system commonly used in web development and API interactions. <br />

                <p className="mt-3 mb-5">
                1. <span className="text-3xl">Access Token</span> : An access token is a credential that is used to gain access to specific resources on behalf of a user.
                It is typically short-lived and has limited permissions.
                Access tokens are obtained by exchanging user credentials like username and password or through other means of authentication e.g., social login.
                 They are sent with each request to the protected resource, allowing the server to verify the users identity and permissions.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-3 mb-5"> <span className="text-3xl">Refresh Token</span> :A refresh token is a credential used to obtain a new access token when the original access token expires.
                Unlike access tokens, refresh tokens are long-lived and can be used to request  new access tokens multiple times without requiring the user to reauthenticate.
                The use of refresh tokens enhances security by reducing the exposure of user credentials.
                </p>

                <p className="mt-3 mb-5"> <span className="text-3xl">How They Work</span> :When a user authenticates and grants permissions, the server issues an access token and a refresh token.
                The access token is used to access protected resources, while the refresh token is securely   stored on the client side.
               When the access token expires, the client can use the refresh token to request a new access token without requiring the user to log in again.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-3 mb-5"> <span className="text-3xl">Where to Store on the Client Side</span> :
                Access Token: This should be stored securely but is typically sent with each request to the API in the Authorization header or as a query parameter.
                It should be stored securely, as its a long-lived credential. Commonly stored in an HTTP-only cookie or local storage on the client side. Storing it securely is crucial to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.

                Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications. It is one of the most popular frameworks for building server-side applications with Node.js. Express simplifies the process of creating powerful, feature-rich web servers and APIs. It is designed to be unopinionated, giving developers the flexibility to organize their application in the way they see fit. Despite its minimalist approach, Express can be extended with various middleware to add functionality.

                <p className="mt-2">
                Routing: Express provides a simple and effective way to define routes and handle HTTP requests.
                <br />

               <p className="mt-1">
               Middleware: It supports middleware functions that have access to the request and response objects, allowing for various pre-processing and post-processing tasks.
               </p>
               <br />
               <p className="mt-1">
               Templating Engines: Express can be used with different templating engines, such as EJS or Pug, to generate dynamic HTML.
               </p>
               <br />
              <p className="mt-1"> Routing and API Handling: It excels in handling both traditional web application routes and building APIs, making it versatile for different types of projects.</p>
                <br />
              <p className="mt-1"> HTTP Utility Methods: Express simplifies the handling of HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.</p>

          Nest.js:Nest.js is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable, and maintainable server-side applications. It is heavily influenced by Angular, a popular front-end framework, and brings some of its concepts and design patterns to the server-side development. Nest.js uses TypeScript by default, providing a strongly-typed and object-oriented programming experience.
          </p>

          <br />

         <p className="mt-1">
         Modularity: Nest.js encourages the use of modules to organize the application into cohesive and reusable components.
         </p>
             <br />
        <p className="mt-1">
        Dependency Injection: It leverages the concept of dependency injection, making it easy to manage and inject dependencies into different parts of the application.
        </p>
           <br />
         <p className="mt-1">
         Decorators: Nest.js uses decorators for defining and configuring modules, controllers, services, and other elements, making the codebase more expressive and readable.
         </p>
     
       
          <br />
        <p className="mt-1">
        Support for WebSockets: Nest.js has built-in support for WebSockets, making it suitable for real-time applications.
        </p>
         <br />
         <p className="mt-1">
         GraphQL Integration: Nest.js has native support for GraphQL, a query language for APIs, making it easy to build GraphQL-based APIs.
